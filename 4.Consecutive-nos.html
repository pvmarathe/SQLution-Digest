                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>You're a data analyst for a large retail chain. The company wants to identify periods of consistently
                    high foot traffic in their stores to optimize staffing and inventory management.</p>
                <h3>Table: DailyFootTraffic</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Column Name</th>
                        <th>Type</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Date</td>
                        <td>date</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Traffic</td>
                        <td>int</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Date is the primary key for this table. Traffic represents the number of customers who visited the
                    store on that date.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>

                </table>
                <p>Write a SQL query to find all traffic levels that appear at least three days consecutively. This will
                    help identify periods of consistently high (or low) foot traffic.</p>

            <section class="solution">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <pre><code>
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Traffic AS ConsecutiveTraffic
FROM 
    DailyFootTraffic l1,
    DailyFootTraffic l2,
    DailyFootTraffic l3
WHERE 
    l1.Traffic = l2.Traffic 
    AND l2.Traffic = l3.Traffic
    AND DATEDIFF(l2.Date, l1.Date) = 1
    AND DATEDIFF(l3.Date, l2.Date) = 1
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section class="explanation">
                <h3>Explanation</h3>
                <p>This SQL query does the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It uses self-joins to compare each day's traffic with the traffic of the next two days.</li>
                    <li>The WHERE clause ensures that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The traffic levels are the same for all three days.</li>
                            <li>The dates are consecutive (using DATEDIFF to check if the difference between dates is
                                exactly 1 day).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>DISTINCT is used to avoid duplicate results if there are more than three consecutive days with
                        the same traffic.</li>
                    <li>The result is aliased as ConsecutiveTraffic for clarity.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This solution effectively identifies traffic levels that occur for at least three consecutive days.
                    It's a valuable technique in retail analytics for recognizing consistent patterns in store traffic,
                    which can inform staffing decisions, inventory management, and marketing strategies.</p>
